# ðŸ“‰ Bank Customer Churn Prediction 

As a Data Analyst, I led the end-to-end customer churn analysis project â€” from SQL-based data extraction and EDA to churn driver identification and visualization of actionable insights. This project supports strategic retention efforts in the banking sector.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (for data extraction), Excel  
- **EDA & Analysis:** Correlation analysis, feature engineering, summary statistics  
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest (Scikit-learn)  
- **Visualization & BI:** Excel Charts, Python Plots (Seaborn), Business-focused storytelling

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow

1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning (SQL + Python)**
   - Wrote complex SQL queries to extract historical banking customer data
   - Cleaned and standardized data for analysis: handled nulls, created derived columns

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified churn patterns using group-by aggregation and correlation heatmaps
   - Segmented customers based on credit score, tenure, activity status, and geography

3. **Churn Driver Analysis**
   - Created derived variables (e.g., product usage intensity, account activity)
   - Ranked key churn predictors using feature importance from models

4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Built churn prediction models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
   - Achieved 85% accuracy on test data, used confusion matrix and ROC for evaluation

5. **Insights & Visualization**
   - Visualized churn trends across customer segments
   - Delivered insights using plots and dashboards to support stakeholder decision-making

## ðŸ“Š Key Business Insights

- Customers with **low product engagement** and **short tenure** are at highest risk of churn  
- **Inactive accounts** and **low credit scores** significantly correlate with churn behavior  
- Recommendations were made for **early intervention campaigns** targeting high-risk segments
